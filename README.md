Visuals I used for research on the Texas natural gas industry. View a brief summary [here](https://ned.vc/tx-gas-report.pdf).

* The ExaGO directory contains backup files and scripts for the visualization of a cyberattack against the Texas natural gas industry
* The risk matrix directory contains the Jupyter notebook I used to create our risk matrix, and can be modified by anyone with a basic grasp of Python
